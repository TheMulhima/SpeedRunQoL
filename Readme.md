- Quickslot (load duped)
- Load duped state from file
- Toggle Bench Storage
- Toggle Collision
- Dreamgate Invulnerability
- Reset Quick Map Storage
- Dupe Active Room
### Colosseum Start Points
Written by CC, adds binds to start Colosseums at different preset points. Currently no support for custom presets or Colos 1/2. All waves start after initial crowd cheer.
Your preset is saved between Colos and save quits.

Written by CC, adds binds to change Main Menu Mode unlocks. Since you can't use binds in the Main Menu, you need to launch a game first and then use them.
